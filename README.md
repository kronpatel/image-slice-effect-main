# Image Slicing Effect and CSS Text Animation Effects

This is an HTML and CSS code snippet that demonstrates an image slicing effect and a CSS text animation effect. The code creates a visually appealing layout with animated text and image transitions.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Create an HTML file and name it, for example, `index.html`.

2. Create a CSS file and name it, for example, `style.css`.

3. Copy the provided HTML code and paste it into the `index.html` file.

4. Copy the provided CSS code and paste it into the `style.css` file.

5. Save both files.

6. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the image slicing effect and the animated text.

## Image Slicing Effect

The image slicing effect is achieved using CSS transitions and transforms. The images are divided into two halves, and when hovering over each image, one half skews and translates to create an interesting visual effect. The effect adds depth and dynamic movement to the images.

## CSS Text Animation Effects

The CSS text animation effect is applied to the `<h2>` element with the text "KRON". The text is transformed into an animated element with a stroke, color, and border. The animation creates a sliding effect on the text, making it visually appealing.

## Customization

You can customize the code to fit your requirements. Here are some possible modifications:

- Images: Replace the image URLs in the `<img>` tags with your desired images. Make sure to use valid image URLs or provide local image file paths.

- Text: Modify the text inside the `<h2>` element to display your desired text.

- Styling: Adjust the CSS properties such as colors, fonts, sizes, positions, and animation durations to achieve your preferred visual effects.

## Compatibility

This code should be compatible with modern web browsers that support CSS transitions and transforms, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
